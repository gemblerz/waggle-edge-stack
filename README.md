# Waggle Edge Stack

The Waggle Edge Stack provides the core services which support running AI@Edge.

The bulk of this repo consists of the [Kubernetes files](./kubernetes/) and scripts required to deploy the stack.

_We are actively working on simplifying the steps required to deploy the stack. In the next couple months, we plan to make this easy to deploy in a standalone mode on a generic Linux machine, Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, etc._
